A Deno module for parsing Among Us packets.
There aren't any docs yet, so just read the modules and [sus.wiki](https://sus.wiki).
The intention of this library is not to provide a solution for creating bots or servers, but to provide the protocol serialization layer that they must be built on top of.

I'm in the [NodePolus discord server](https://dimaguyhateclub.com), say hi!

Resources:
- [NodePolus](https://github.com/NodePolus) for the name and a few files.
- [sus.wiki](https://sus.wiki) for the packet descriptions and formats.
